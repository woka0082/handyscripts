This script is inspired by https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/Top-5-Bootloader-Themes. 
The change is to automatically scan the themes folder and list all the available themes. 
It saves the trouble for the user to edit the install script when a new theme is added. 
The sample theme here is from https://www.pling.com/s/All-Linux/p/2138019

obviously to try it:

chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
