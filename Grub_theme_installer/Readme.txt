## Overview

This script is inspired by the project available at [Chris Titus Tech's Top 5 Bootloader Themes](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/Top-5-Bootloader-Themes). The primary enhancement implemented in this version is the automation of theme scanning within the themes folder. This improvement allows the script to dynamically list all available themes, eliminating the need for manual edits to the installation script when new themes are added.

## Sample Theme

For demonstration purposes, the sample theme utilized in this project can be found at [Pling](https://www.pling.com/s/All-Linux/p/2138019).

## Installation Instructions

To install the script, please follow these steps:

1. Make the installation script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   ```

2. Execute the installation script with superuser privileges:
   ```bash
   sudo ./install.sh
   ```
