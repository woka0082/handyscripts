##### WARNING #####
For the sake of your sanity, backup your grub config file if you haven't already just in case!
Usually:
/boot/grub/grub.cfg
sudo cp /boot/grub/grub.cfg /boot/grub/grub.cfg.BAK
### WARNING OVER ###

Now then extract the file:
dark-eos-grub.tar.xz
into a tmp folder (or wherever you like) then within the dark-eos-grub folder extarct whichevrer theme.txt variant you want.
There's three.
dark-eos-arch-glow-logo-theme.txt.tar.xz
dark-eos-astronaut-theme.txt.tar.xz
dark-eos-endeavouros-logo-theme.txt.tar.xz
overwriting the theme.txt file.
The default is the astronaut.
4 different font sizes provided which can better suit your resolution at boot up time 16,18,24 and 32, see within theme.txt for details.
The higher your resolution the higher the font should be, I've tested 18 at 1080p and that works well. Ymmv.
Now copy or move with sudo rights the dark-eos-grub folder into your grub themes folder, usually:
/boot/grub/themes
then change your grub theme with sudo rights again, usually:
/etc/default/grub
where you should find a line like:
#GRUB_THEME="/path/to/gfxtheme/theme.txt"
now paste this:
GRUB_THEME="/boot/grub/themes/dark-eos-grub/theme.txt"
above or below it or if it's not there add it.
Save the file and close.
Now lastly update grub, usually:
sudo update-grub
but your distro may vary.
Reboot and enjoy.

* If you have a passworded grub menu I'm not sure if the
password_field.png
will be used or look right as I don't have this feature enabled in my grub.
Ymmv.
