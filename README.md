# This is my small handy scripts to do the system setup and customization

These are mainly for myself to install and customise my own computers. I used Endeavous OS and Arch, so most of these scripts use pacman and yay when installing new packages. 
Everyone can use them and change them for free.
I can't promise they always work on any other systems, won't break your systems and cause any damages, so as always, look at them first and make sure you understand what they will do before you run them. 
Back up your system!!!
