# Welcome to My Handy System Setup Scripts!

Hello and welcome! This repository contains a collection of scripts that I've created to help with system setup and customization. While these are primarily designed for my own use on EndeavourOS and Arch, they can be a valuable resource for anyone looking to streamline their Linux experience.

## Purpose

These scripts aim to assist both new users and experienced individuals who may be helping othersâ€”like family and friends transitioning from Windows to Linux. They provide a quick way to install and customize essential software without needing extensive research.

## Usage

Feel free to use, modify, and share these scripts as you see fit! They are free to use and designed to make your setup process smoother. However, please note that while I strive for reliability, I cannot guarantee they will work flawlessly on every system. Always proceed with caution and back up your data.

## Happy Exploring!

Thank you for checking out my scripts! I hope they make your journey into Linux a little easier. Good luck, and happy customizing!
